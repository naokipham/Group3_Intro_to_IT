        <h1 align="center">Tools and Technologies</h1>
        <p>Our product is a physical smart device that requires a complex operating system and built-in software support, as well as 3rd-party API protocols. Consequently, it necessitates a wide array of tools and software from various areas of the IT industry, even further spanning multiple cross-discipline fields. </p>
        <h3>Front-end Development Tools: </h3>
        <p>To facilitate the front-end development of the product, our design team, responsible for the product's appearance and hardware components, will rely on 3D modeling and visualization software. Additionally, collaboration between our Augmented Reality specialists and the hardware team is essential to create a more immersive and responsive user interface within AR environments. This collaboration necessitates the use of AR development Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>SolidWorks (Educational license provided by SSET department):</b> A powerful Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool, which can help us design the prototype model for 3d-printing and feasibility validation purposes. It would be mainly used by our design team in charge of product appearance and components assembly. </li>
            <li><b>Unity 3D (Free-to-use for educational purposes):</b>one of the best practice IDE for AR application development. It can be used as the primary IDE for our AR team. </li>
            <li><b>Blender (Free-to-use for educational purposes):</b>Useful for 3D visualizations and animation, it would benefit the processes of both prototype design and AR integration</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Back-end Development Tools: </h3>
        <p>For the back-end development of the product, our software developers require an IDE that empowers efficient mass development and debugging processes. This IDE should also support seamless team collaboration and adhere to modern agile development processes. The database management tools and solutions must be robust and scalable, given our significant data processing requirements, especially concerning large language datasets. The adoption of well-established and mature AI frameworks will significantly save our development efforts and time from reinventing the wheels, thus a coding IDE tailored to AI development is highly desirable. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Visual Studio 2022 (Version 17.7.4, educational license provided by SSET department):</b>A powerful coding IDE providing robust and team-friendly environment. The debugging feature is one of the best in the current market of IDEs. It also supports various programming languages including some low-level languages like C, which is indispensable for our development team for embedded programming due to the physical characteristics of our product.</li>
            <li><b>PostgreSQL database system (open-source):</b>An open-source relational database system renowned for its advanced features, extensibility, and support for complex data types. It can meet our high requirement of big-data processing while ensuring scalability of the system in the future.</li>
            <li><b>PyCharm (Version 2023.2, educational license provided by SSET department):</b>To facilitate the usage of cutting-edge modern AI framework. Python programming language and its rich open-source library for AI and Machine Learning is essential to our AI development team. Therefore, introducing PyCharm, a well-rounded coding IDE suited for this purpose, would yield significant advantages. </li>
            <li><b>TensorFlow (Open-source): </b> An open-source machine learning framework primarily developed by Google, serving as a cornerstone in our project's quest to leverage latest technologies as Deep Learning and Neural Networks. With its mature toolbox and libraries, TensorFlow will empower our team to infuse our product with the core algorithm akin to breathing life into a piece of glasses.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Project management & Version Control tools </h3>
        <p>Regardless of whether it's front-end or back-end development, project management and version control tools are indispensable for ensuring the success of our team's efforts.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Git Hub</b>(Free-to-use, and additional features for student accounts), serves as a pivotal platform for version control and project management, especially for development part regarding coding process, such as web development for our homepage. Although it is one of the best practices already established in the IT world, our team is still continuously making efforts to get more familiar and fluent with the skills of maneuvering and working with it for a better collaboration performance. </li>
            <li><a href="https://clickup.com">clickup.com</a>(Free-to-use): Offers a Gantt timeline solution to enhance the project management and team collaboration aspects of our project. It provides a user-friendly platform that helps time management of our project significantly. By leveraging its powerful features, our team can efficiently plan and track project timelines, allocate resources, and help ensure tasks are completed on schedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, our marketing and presentation team will also need tool support to foster initial growth and validate our business model. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Microsoft Office 365</b>(educational license provided by our school) serves as an integral and versatile tool set in our project. It is actually the software series that we have spent most time and effort on in our current planning & designing stages. </li>
            <li><b>Canva</b>(limited features within free accounts): A versatile presentation slide design tool with intuitive UI design, making it suitable for team members with little prior IT experience to quickly get familiar with the workflow and produce graphically appealing presentation material. </li>
            <li><b>Microsoft Power BI</b> (Educational license by our school): A tool enabling our future marketing team capabilities for data visualization, analysis, and reporting. It can affect our decision process and future sustainability and profitability development. Its significance to our team will become increasingly pronounced as we continue to expand our scale in the future if everything goes smoothly and successfully. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Last but not least, regarding the skills of tools and software of our current team members, it's worth noting that our team primarily consists of freshman students, and our proficiency in using these tools and software is not yet advanced. However, we have gradually become more accustomed to Microsoft Office software suites and version control tools like GitHub. This learning adjustment has been driven much by our motivation to effectively and comprehensively complete assignments in our Essentials of IT course. </p>
