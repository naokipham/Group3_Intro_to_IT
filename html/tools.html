<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
  This project is the first-time experience for most team members in developing a website while utilizing GitHub as a
  version control system. Initially, the team found the concepts and mechanisms of a version control system challenging.
  However, after attending tutorial sessions and receiving comprehensive explanations from our lecturer, we gradually
  adapted to this approach.
</p>
<p>
  In the initial days of web development, the process appeared to proceed smoothly. However, as we increased the
  frequency of code commits from our individual branches to the main branch, we started to frequently encounter issues
  of code conflicts. Some of these conflicts were complex and exceeded our existing skill set. If we analyze and review
  about these issues, they were most likely generated by version differences between our individual branches and the
  main branch, which made the pull request & merge actions inefficient to conduct.
</p>
<p>
  After unsuccessful attempts to merge code from various branches into the main branch, we opted for alternative
  solutions. In the context of software engineering, “Getting Things Done” is sometimes prioritized over perfecting the
  process. Consequently, we created a new repository to integrate our code. This attempt is successful, which enabled
  the team to resume effective development and code commits.
</p>
<p>
  As of this report's conclusion, we have successfully developed a website featuring an aesthetically pleasing design
  that adheres to the principles of minimalism and practicality. The website leverages HTML and CSS, employing code
  separation principles to store HTML, CSS, and image resources separately, ensuring code maintainability. The code is
  also well-structured for efficient rendering performance.
</p>

<p>
  Upon reviewing the audit trail of our repositories, it is evident that each team member has contributed to the
  project, although some more than others due to internal task allocation. Chen initiated the first repository and
  tested features like GitHub Pages and GitHub Desktop. Subsequently, Zyra, Zenn, and Linn, who have a keen interest in
  web technologies, significantly contributed to the codebase. Zyra designed the basic layout for the homepages and the
  structure of the whole site, while Zenn and Linn focused on sub-pages,which are key components of the website
  contents,. They introduce various categories of layouts and image resources during the development process. They also
  managed to implement form-filling features, significantly making our sites more interactive instead of being too
  static regarding UI experience.
</p>

<p>
  Initially, our comment history reflected a lack of familiarity with GitHub’s best practices. Over time, we recognized
  the importance of documentation, resulting in more readable and self-explanatory commit histories by our attached
  comments.
</p>

<p>
  In addition to coding, the team regularly conducted code reviews and provided feedback for more enhanced web design
  and user interface experience. However, We had not realized we can conduct reviewing process in “Issue” section of
  GitHub until recent time. For future improvement, we can try making use of “Issue” section to realize a better
  inner-cycle workflow in GitHub.
</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>
  In summary, the opportunity to develop this project provided valuable insights for us into utilizing GitHub and its
  integrative coordination role in the web development process.
