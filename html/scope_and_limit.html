    <h1> Scope & Limit</h1>

    <p> People may utilize phones to converse with foreigners using translation apps to better grasp the culture and comprehend what they are saying as technology advances. These uses, nevertheless, are not necessarily ideal. For example, going shopping is usually rather cumbersome since you have to scrutinize each product one by one, a process that takes a long time. So, we decided to introduce you to one of the smartest products "NB Glasses,
        " which allows you to comprehend and even speak in a foreign language without having to work hard or study. Furthermore, it can assist people with disabilities such as blindness, deafness, and mute people in communicating with each other through these AR glasses via micro speakers and the simulation program, which uses an integrated miniature camera and two miniature microphones hidden in the glasses to record the other person's gestures and words, 
        which will then be broadcast on a small screen on the glasses frame with the technical part. It will allow the user to grasp the dialogue and smooth the little processing circuit to help translate and offer responses for the user to react to the other person.

        We developed the item to be as straightforward and affordable as possible while still maintaining the efficacy and quality that we have made in order to provide it to people in the most comprehensive way possible at an inexpensive price. targeted from the beginning. NBglasses will be developed to interpret popular languages like English and Chinese.

        Furthermore, users may use it to watch movies, play games, or browse social media using virtual reality incorporated into the glasses to raise user interest and provide the finest experience. To create a product, we need a design for the glasses model, an OLED or microLED screen for the glasses and simulated visuals, a tiny microphone to capture the speech, and a processing circuit to translate the results and deliver them to the user. All processed information will be sent to the user's ears through two tiny speakers located on the frame of the glasses. Finally, there is a tiny battery that enables users to charge and operate the device without the need for a charger. It took my team seven months to realize this idea, and we spent one month designing and developing the final design. Then, over the next two 

    months, we will begin searching for materials, parts, and components for the product in preparation for the final assembly procedures. Two months for coding and learning new languages. specialized language to aid the circuit's processing and delivery of the necessary outputs. The next two months are dedicated to assembly and testing in order to provide the finished product to clients. The most significant drawback of NB eyewear devices is that they can only assist users with translating simple languages like English, Vietnamese, and Chinese. Furthermore, we only fitted the glasses with a modest battery that lasts up to five hours on a single charge to optimize the form of the glasses and make them more attractive.

        In summary, NBglasses are a gadget that allows users to interpret and converse with foreigners, assisting individuals who have trouble interacting and understanding the customs of different nations.
