    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <p>The primary specific aim of NBglasses is to help people worldwide overcome language barriers and enhance cross-cultural communication. Furthermore, it places a distinct emphasis on providing support for individuals with disabilities, significantly improving their social experiences. With the assistance of NBglasses, people from around the world will find it easier to engage in international travel and receive rapid, real-time translation assistance when communicating with local residents in foreign countries. The translation efficiency of this product would surpass that of traditional and even most of current translation tools, revolutionizing communication efficiency among individuals who speak different languages. Additionally, an area that has been rarely explored in the past, "Translation between individuals with disabilities and physically healthy individuals without disabilities," will now be realized and supported, filling a gap in social welfare and meeting economy-wise market demands. This is a tangible product that will prioritize ease of use, maintainable manufacturing costs, and suitability for mass production. The goal is for NBglasses to be widely accepted by the general public, not limited to few rich people as fancy toys.</p>
    <p>To achieve this primary aim, we need to accomplish several sub-goals:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Intuitive User Interface:</b>Design an intuitive user interface that allows elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities to easily learn how to use the product. This will help the product's widespread acceptance among people. </li>
            <li><b>Frame Material and Component Selection:</b>Create a comprehensive database for natural language, including audio and text data. The database's structure should be designed to be universally compatible, allowing for compatibility of languages from around the world and serving users from a broader range of countries and regions.
            </li>
            <li><b>Build a Sign Language Database:</b>Focus on building a database for sign language, with a particular emphasis on modeling image information. Mappings from image to semantic need to be stored and available for retrieval, utilizing application of AI neural network technology. </li> 
	</ol>
        <p>Additionally, there are some optional goals that can significantly enhance the product's attractiveness and competitiveness: </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Offline Translation Functionality:</b>Develop an offline translation feature for travelers, especially in situations where local network connections may be unreliable, such as right after landing. The offline translation function will further enhance the product's user experience. However, this requires algorithm engineers to develop compression algorithms and more compact local models. </li>
            <li><b>Multimodal Translation:</b>Enable the product to consider multiple channels of input during language translation. This includes not only the meaning of natural language itself but also the talker's body actions and expressions. This addition of emotional elements to translations makes them more natural and cordial.</li>
            <li><b>Collaboration with Educational and Medical Institutions:</b>Collaborate with educational and medical institutions and share relevant data with these organizations. This collaboration will help educational and medical institutions explore how to better serve individuals with disabilities and facilitate their integration into mainstream society.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>However, if the project's resources and time are limited, the most critical primary aim and most important aspect of this product should remain ensuring the provision of real-time, seamless translation services and offering special support for individuals with disabilities. This will be the core competitiveness and significance of the product. </p>

    <h2>Plans and Progress</h2>
    <h3>Stage 1: Crew Background & Preliminary Planning</h3>
    <p>When our team first encountered this project task, we soon began a comprehensive brainstorming session. Regarding the team's background, each of our members is deeply interested in technological trends and is passionate about the integration of technology with culture and humanities. It's worth noting that our team consists of three international students: two from Myanmar and one from China. For these crew members, Vietnam offers a distinct and markedly divergent social environment compared to their countries of origin. Upon arriving in Vietnam, they have faced with considerable challenges in language expression and cultural communication, deeply experiencing the inconveniences and frustrations wrought by language barriers in both their daily lives and even academic endeavors. After preliminary team discussions, we expeditiously reached a consensus on the main direction for our project: To bridge divides between people hailing from different regions and cultures, with an emphasis on facilitating cross-cultural communication. Subsequent brainstorming sessions yielded the concept of conceiving a product to facilitate translation across various languages.</p>
    <h3>Stage 2: Further Exploration and Investigation</h3>
    <p>We subsequently partitioned task and embarked on a research endeavor to explore current available hardware and software translating solutions on the market. Our investigation revealed that while Google Translate enjoys widespread usage and offers support for a multitude of languages, there exist noteworthy areas where enhancement can be made. When use an app like Google Translate, it often results in conversations with slow and inefficient pace that can frustrate users, lacking rapid real-time translation capabilities. Moreover, translation precision is not consistently dependable, particularly when confronted with idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, or less widely-spoken languages(compared to popular language like English), such as those languages originating from Southeast Asia. Another limitation pertains to the necessity for users to physically hold their phones, curtailing their freedom and rendering social interactions stiffer and less organic. 
    During our second meetup, inspired by team member Dean, we considered developing a hardware product to address these limitations.We contemplated that a pair of eyeglasses could serve as an optimal solution for several reasons:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Primarily, eyeglasses offer portability, catering to the perpetual translation requirements of individuals in foreign traveller setup. </li>
        <li>Secondly, eyeglasses inherently exhibit a user-friendly design that holds broad appeal among the general population. A product with eyeglasses characteristics also has the potential to be advantageous for marketing strategy, as exemplified by past campaigns, notably the Apple Watch campaign by Apple. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stage 3: In-depth Research </h3>
    <p>After our second meetup, we scoured the internet to gather data and assess the feasibility of our product idea. We discovered that there are existing products with similar features and ideas. One notable example is Apple's recently released Vision Pro, a powerful Augmented Reality (AR) product with various imaginative and magical applications. However, upon reviewing relevant YouTube videos, we found that Vision Pro has its limitations: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, its high Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) makes it beyond the reach of the average consumer. </li>
        <li>Secondly, its hefty product weight can lead to discomfort when worn by users for extended durations, thus diminishing its suitability for continuous usage. </li>
    </ul>
	<p>During our third meetup, we pondered whether our product idea remained viable given the impending release of Vision Pro. After detailed analysis, we concluded that our product could not only address the shortcomings of Vision Pro but also bring unique features and functionalities. Our product would be lighter, more affordable, and have a longer battery life. Moreover, we uncovered a novel opportunity: directing our focus toward assisting marginalized communities, thereby introducing a distinctive highlight point and carving out a unique niche for our product. 
    </p>
    <h3>Stage 4: Current Progress Stage </h3>
    <p>As of writing this report, we are still in the research and planning phase for our product, named "NBGlasses." We recognize the complexity and scope of managing such a project. To that end, we are learning to incorporate project management tools like Gantt charts. Additionally, we are currently in the midst of crafting presentation slides, a pivotal step in enticing potential angel investors and gaining a comprehensive grasp of our product's present scope and constraints for potential clients and our development team. We are meticulously devising testing protocols and scheduling to maximize our progress within the confines of the available time frame. </p>
    <h3>Future Contingency Plan: Key Focus for Successor Development Teams </h3>
    <p>If the project needs to be handed over to another team for unforeseen reasons, the new team may be advised to focus on the following challenges: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Collecting language data:</b> This undertaking is of considerable magnitude, demanding significant financial resources and meticulous planning of system architecture. Whether opting for an in-house development approach or leveraging third-party APIs, judicious strategic planning remains imperative.  </li>
        <li><b>Material picking and ergonomic design:</b> This area is often overlooked but could be a decisive factor that sets our product apart from competitors.</li>
        <li><b>Engaging with the educational and medical sectors:</b> The integration of social responsibility and a heightened emphasis on the humanities can exert a substantial impact on enhancing the product's competitive advantage. </li>
        <li><b>Resources - Acquisition and training of essential technical talent:</b> The assembly of a proficient and harmonious startup team will decisively shape the project's outcome, ultimately determining its success or failure. </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Roles</h2>
    <!-- <p>
      Our team does not have a defined working stance; we frequently collaborate and share perspectives, which we then document and use to make the ultimate decision on the project. Furthermore, in order to complete the product as fast as possible, we split the work for each team member based on the abilities of each team member and can alter if we have the same item in common. a strong suit. Do you believe this will lead my team to function less effectively than other teams, despite the fact that their members each have unique expertise along with their shares specifically? Although our group may operate more slowly, this does not imply that we are weaker. Instead, we collaborate to better understand each other, and each activity that we complete together will assist. done in the most flawless way possible in accordance with the group's objective, which I had set forth from the start of the group's establishment. The way we operate and have a dream team like this is based on the continual efforts and rigors we set for ourselves to reach great successes and acquire what we desire.

        <ul>
            <li><b>Git Hub</b>(Free-to-use, and additional features for student accounts), serves as a pivotal platform for version control and project management, especially for development part regarding coding process, such as web development for our homepage. Although it is one of the best practices already established in the IT world, our team is still continuously making efforts to get more familiar and fluent with the skills of maneuvering and working with it for a better collaboration performance. </li>
            <li><a href="https://clickup.com">clickup.com</a>(Free-to-use): Offers a Gantt timeline solution to enhance the project management and team collaboration aspects of our project. It provides a user-friendly platform that helps time management of our project significantly. By leveraging its powerful features, our team can efficiently plan and track project timelines, allocate resources, and help ensure tasks are completed on schedule.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Finally, our marketing and presentation team will also need tool support to foster initial growth and validate our business model. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Microsoft Office 365</b>(educational license provided by our school) serves as an integral and versatile tool set in our project. It is actually the software series that we have spent most time and effort on in our current planning & designing stages. </li>
            <li><b>Canva</b>(limited features within free accounts): A versatile presentation slide design tool with intuitive UI design, making it suitable for team members with little prior IT experience to quickly get familiar with the workflow and produce graphically appealing presentation material. </li>
            <li><b>Microsoft Power BI</b> (Educational license by our school): A tool enabling our future marketing team capabilities for data visualization, analysis, and reporting. It can affect our decision process and future sustainability and profitability development. Its significance to our team will become increasingly pronounced as we continue to expand our scale in the future if everything goes smoothly and successfully. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Last but not least, regarding the skills of tools and software of our current team members, it's worth noting that our team primarily consists of freshman students, and our proficiency in using these tools and software is not yet advanced. However, we have gradually become more accustomed to Microsoft Office software suites and version control tools like GitHub. This learning adjustment has been driven much by our motivation to effectively and comprehensively complete assignments in our Essentials of IT course. </p>

    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p>Before it can be made available to the public as a new viable choice on the market, our product, like any other decent project out there, must go through several rigorous testing sessions. According to experts from Qualtrics (ref), product testing brings about several benefits. Including but not limited to quality and reliability assurance, overall cost reduction, helping you determine the service life of your product, and potentially reducing the cost and resources required for the aftercare of a customer. Thus, we had to put in careful consideration when deciding on how best to test our product.</p>
        <p>Two different testing phases will be carried out. First, we will start off with concept testing. Concept testing is a type of research method in which you ask your target audience questions about your project ideas (ref). It is cost-effective and simple to carry out. For our project, we will start off by targeting the two main audience groups we would like to reach, frequent travelers and people with sensory disabilities including speech, hearing, and sight.  We will conduct 4 varying Single Concept Evaluation surveys with a size of about 200 people each (800 in total). Despite being slightly more costly than other types of survey, it will give us the most detailed feedback and it typically has a higher and faster response rate. The main purpose of this test will be to figure out the viability of our product, desirability, and the likelihood of purchase considering the price. With a clear and concise flow and language, our survey should be easy to answer. Once we receive feedback from our target audience, we will identify the concept that has the highest favorability. To conclude our concept testing, we will then move on to the next development stage using the most suitable concept. </p>
        <p>this phase with a smaller number of users will most certainly give assurance and guidance towards developing the most user-friendly and palpable solutions and products catering towards removing language barriers. All in all, these are two methods of testing we will implement in our development stag For the second phase of the product testing, we will carry out user observation testing. This simply means that we will be observing how the users use our glasses and gathering data in areas that are received well and potential bugs that cause frustration in a natural setting. This method of testing allows us to get an insight into the user experience and build relations with the users. After creating a product based on the response from the first testing stage and going through several trial-and-error runs until we have a pair of glasses that we feel satisfied with, we will carry out this phase of product testing. To find test users, we will pick out random colleagues and customers of the product. The scale of this testing stage should be around twelve users. A specific background is not required as we want our evaluation to be as spread out and relatable as possible to the normal everyday user. Carrying out several tests in e.</p>

  <section id="r8" class="section section-three">
    <h2>Risks</h2>
    <p>There are risks associated with the development of this project, NBglasses, as with numerous other projects. To produce and launch a functional and feasible product, we would require the appropriate technology, the ability to understand the technicality of this project, teamwork, marketing capabilities, an ample amount of capital investment, and luck. In other aspects of life, there is no such thing as a reward without risks similarly our project comes with its own risks. The following are some of the risks we must take to set this project up. </p>
        <h3><u>1.Lack of skills & experience + Technology risks</u></h3>
        <p>These are the risks associated with our technical abilities and lack of experience working towards developing a product with a team.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Lack of technical skills & knowledge:</b>
            <br>As our team is full of freshmen, we do not have the best of abilities and a steady stream of knowledge yet. This would be a problem to deal with as this project requires copious amounts of skill including but not limited to using PyTorch for Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision for different sensory recognitions, and translations, along with the ability to create an Augmented Reality environment, and an ability to utilize Artificial Intelligence is needed. Similarly, some soft skills, namely time management, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving are necessary as well.  </li>
            <li><b>Lack of experience in development</b></li>
            <li><b>Lack of appropriate technology:</b>
            <br>Software such as Computer Vision(CV), Augmented Reality(AR), Natural Language Processing(NLP), and AI, along with hardware such as a circuit that is capable of supporting various wireless connections, a headset with a lightweight body, cameras, microphones, and multiple sensors are requirements for this project. We might not have the funding needed to financially support all these resources in the beginning, which may take a toll on our results. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>2.Market risks </u></h3>
        <p>When developing a product and launching it, there will be market risks such as profitability and product pricing as capital is a crucial part of a startup. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Profitability & product pricing:  </b>
            <br>Our product will need to be profitable but also have reasonable product pricing that is affordable to the general public and not just the rich. We need to determine the perfect balancing point or our product might not be a viable option to our consumers. </li>
            <li><b>Investment:  </b>
            <br>There is a risk and possibility that we might not lure in enough investors to fund our project which might lead to some shortcomings.</li>
            <li><b>Competition/ Marketability: </b>
            <br>Many strong and well-known competitors such as Google have already expanded into this field. We will have to compete with them, thus the risk of whether our product would be marketable and be able to stand on its own against such competition is also a crucial determinant of our product success.  
        </li>
	</ul>
        <h3><u>3.Internal Conflict</u></h3>
        <p>When working in team environments, it is normal to have some level of conflict, due to this reason, we should expect some creative differences and various perceptions of the project and ideas. We must try to mitigate between each other and find the middle ground or back our arguments with reason. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Issues with internal conflict:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Time management:</i> With people having an argument in a team due to creative differences or anything else, we would need to have sufficient time to meet the customers expectations. </li>
                <li><i>Lack of communication reflected in poor output:</i>Without proper communication, we would have difficulty creating a viable product. The overall cost might also increase due to the increased number of follow-ups and trial runs we may need to make. This links back to the market risk of profitability. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>4.Product Risks</u></h3>
        <p>The functionality and feasibility of our product negate numerous risks as well. For developing and launching our product, questions such as how successful our product would be and how reliable our product will be are two good questions to keep in mind. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Poor performance in the market  </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>5.unforeseeable risks</u></h3>
        <p>Luck is a big factor in the success of a new product. Life is unpredictable. Take the Great Depression as an example, numerous businesses went under and a lot of them were unable to foresee what would happen to them abruptly. Thus, we would need to prepare for such factors as well.</p>

    	<h2>Group processes and communications </h2>
    	<p>Taking experience from practice during group activity for assignment 2 of the Intro to IT course, we realized that although the group did not have any major conflicts during the working process, efficiency and results were greatly delayed. It happened due to not being proactive. This means we must set basic regulations to change the above phenomenon: </p>
        <h3>Contact channel: </h3>
        <p>Project members will communicate with each other through a group chat on the Facebook Messenger platform. This group chat is a communication channel, in addition to reminding divided tasks and deadlines for each member, this is also a place where members can freely share difficulties encountered during work so that other members can support them. support. In case of emergency when we need to contact other members, we will contact them via personal phone number.</p>
        <h3>Working channel: </h3>
        <p>We work on Microsoft 365 and Microsoft OneDrive. As for Onedrive, this is an online document repository so we share a common workplace for members. All folders or files related to the project are placed together in the shared folder for team members. This, in addition to allowing members to quickly access files, is also a way for group members to check each other's progress. Microsoft 365 is software that members will work directly with files such as reports or presentation designs. There are also other applications and tools that members can use depending on the nature of the project such as Github, Canva, etc.</p>
        <h3>Meeting</h3>
        <p>Regarding the content of the meetings, we often have meetings to report and evaluate progress, then assign the next tasks to team members according to plan. We often voluntarily accept tasks and tasks that no one else has taken on will be divided equally with the contributions of all members. We will mostly meet face-to-face, however, if there are meetings where all members cannot be present, we will meet online through Microsoft Team. </p>
        <h3>Frequency</h3>
        <p>All team members are encouraged to message the group about daily work progress, mainly difficulties encountered while working so that the whole team can promptly handle it. In addition, every week the group will always have a meeting to report progress (mandatory) and continue assigning tasks, usually on Thursday.</p>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>We also set some basic rules with each other when working together to avoid possible conflicts and arguments: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> When assigned a task, the member must reply or at least react (like or heart) to the message as a confirmation that you have read the task and agree with the assigned task as well as the deadline. </li>
            <li>Be on time. Complete deadlines on time no matter what your reasons are. For group meetings, you must also arrive on time, and for special cases, you can arrive up to 10 minutes late and must give a reasonable reason for that.</li>
            <li>If you want to change the deadline, please notify everyone at least 1 day in advance. Also tell the group the reason, the difficulty, and the date you will submit it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Note:</b>If one of the members violates the above rules for the first or second time, they will be warned in front of the whole group. If that member continues to behave like that, especially procrastinating or neglecting the group work, we will write it on our peer evaluation and send your case to the lecturer for a final decision. </p>
