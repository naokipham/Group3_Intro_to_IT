            		<h3>Phyu Phyu Shinn Thant (Zyra) </h3>
		<p> Some tasks went well, such as dividing our sections and working on our individual sections. 
      There are a few things that can be improved, including communication, and time management. 
                Compared to our first assignment, I believe we lacked a bit more communication this time 
                around since we were not able to have as many face-to-face meetings. Due to this reason,
                our time management was relatively flawed. One thing that came across as surprising was 
                the web development section. In the beginning, according to the lecturer, we thought we
                would only need a basic HTML website with minimal design and user-friendliness, however,
                this turned out to be untrue if a group wanted to get HD, DI, or CR. We had to at least
                incorporate CSS for web design as well. Personally, I learned that groups, in general,
                need communication and different roles for each member to allow us to work more efficiently 
                and effectively in a team environment. 
                </p>

                <h3> Linn Htin Nyo(Dean) </h3>
		<p> Honestly, I thought we were doing better than previous assignments this time because we had 
		a meeting as early as possible to set duty for each member to write report section and the 
		plan to go step by step, an outline of our project. Communication between members could have 
		been better, especially if every person in this group knew that they are also responsible 
		for every error we ran into unexpectedly, could have improved a lot of problems such as time 
		management and team coordination. One thing that surprised me was building a website is such 
		an artistic thing as an IT student must be able to achieve. Due to how useful it is for your
		career to move forward if a person knows HTML, CSS and JavaScript more than as a side knowledge.
		In conclusion, I believe if we were working as a group, we need to make sure that everyone has the
		same amount of duty and responsibility as well as set the deadlines and need to proofread every raw
		document before its completion as a final. Plus, all members should keep in mind that they need to
		be ready to fix any unexpected errors and should be flexible to give new documentation if needed.

                <h3> Chen Zhengbo(Chen) </h3>
		<p> Throughout this semester, my experience as a team member has provided me with valuable
		insights into the strengths and weaknesses of teamwork. Our team shares a strong passion
		for IT knowledge and achieving high scores in our coursework, which I consider to be
		a great point as team characteristics.
		</p>
		<p> However, there is room for improvement in how we assign tasks. Currently, our approach is to divide the
		work evenly among team members, regardless of their skills and workflow. This method, while well-intentioned,
		may not be the most effective. It often leads to members working on their sections separately, reducing the 
		opportunity for coherent collaboration among teammates. In the future, we may want to consider assigning tasks
		based on skills and workflow for better results. </p>
		<p> One crucial lesson I've learned about our group is the importance of efficient communication.
		Our primary communication tool this semester was Facebook Messenger. While it is functional, 
		it lacks some of the more efficient communication options, such as audio and video calls. 
		On this platform, our chat history is not well-structured, leading to wasted time when trying
		to reference and search past conversations. To address these communication challenges as a group,
		we might consider adopting modern team apps like Slack and Discord. </p>

		<h3> Nguyen Thanh Dat(Tommy) </h3>
		<p> It was an exciting experiment to study IT with me for the first semester. I learned more about the IT sector and how crucial it is to play a role in assisting the globe's development. Working with a team also helped me grasp the importance of having a solid team and understanding how to 
		contact each other to work and accomplish our duties together. However, we continue to struggle
		with exchanging ideas and finding answers, but we manage it specifically. This task, I believe,
		is superior to the prior one since it encouraged me to be more creative. One of the most essential
		skills I've learned from working in a team is to always be accountable for the job done by your 
		team and to complete it on time. The most exciting thing that made me feel is that we understand 
		how to design and create websites for presentations so that other people may learn about our ideas
		and how it might be a future technology that helps individuals who are tough to talk to. In conclusion,
		studying IT is one of the finest decisions I've ever made, and I hope that I will work hard to attain
		the goal that I set for myself when I decided to study IT.

                <h3>Pham Nguyen Hoang Ngan (Zenn) </h3>
		<p>When I first started this assignment, I took a quick look at the assignment requirements and was shocked by how realistic they were. "Making a detailed plan for a project like a startup, really?" was the first question that came to mind, followed by concern about the risks I would face because I hadn't done this before. But I also enjoy difficulties, so I arrived with an upbeat mood and strongly high expectations for this exercise. Indeed, after beginning to work with my team, I learned a lot of things, including not just how to construct a plan, but also teamwork skills. I've learned a lot about myself, including how to prepare a plan, use Gantt charts to manage work progress, cooperate, and work on Github, particularly how to program in HTML and CSS. Furthermore, this activity provided me with valuable experience working in a group. It is essential to establish clear rules and punishments from the start in order to avoid unneeded fights. I assumed that following the last exercise's cooperation ( though there were still minor disagreements), we would be more familiar with it and be able to cooperate better this time, but we actually had larger conflicts. Through this, I may have learned how to choose partners and what teamwork style is best for me. However, after all, I honestly want to say "thank you" to my teammate for helping me complete this assignment.</p>

			<h2> Overall Group Reflection </h2>
			<p>Over the course of this semester, our team has gained valuable insights into both the positive and challenging aspects of teamwork in the IT 	field. </p>

			<h3>What Worked Well</h3>
		<p> Our team fully formed around the middle of the semester. Once assembled, we made concerted efforts to get along and familiarize ourselves with each other. This resulted in a cooperative atmosphere that was beneficial for both our productivity and the mood of individuals. Our team's diverse backgrounds have enriched our capability to generate ideas from various perspectives.
Many of us are highly passionate about IT and share the goal of earning a high grade in the course. This common objective has laid the foundation for effective teamwork.
We also prioritized early meetings to discuss task assignments and project details, which has helped us stay on schedule and reduce the risk of missing deadlines. </p>

<h3> Areas for Improvement </h3>
<p> Despite the teamwork parts we relatively succeed on, there are areas that need attention. Our primary mode of communication has been online chat apps, notably Messenger, without enough in-person meetings. We’ve found that the depth of engagement differs significantly between virtual and face-to-face interactions, affecting overall performance. To remedy this, we can plan to schedule more in-person sessions in the future.
In terms of time management, we recognized that although we aim for high grades, achieving this goal requires careful planning. We observed that stress levels increase as deadlines approach closer, often leading to rushed work and lower quality. To improve, we plan to familiarize ourselves with time management systems and raise awareness about the pitfalls of procrastination. </p>

<h3> Surprising Challenges </h3>
<p> Along the way, we've encountered a few surprises. For instance, some of us were unprepared for the complexities of web development techniques. Coding in real-life environment comes with its set of challenges due to the ever-changing external variables and complexity of software in the real-world development environment. This experience has emphasized the need for our continuous learning.
We also faced challenges with GitHub. While we were excited about its practical usage, the steep learning curve has generated troublesome difficulties to us. We realized that to fully utilize GitHub, we would need to invest more time to try and learn than initially anticipated. </p>

<h3> Lessons on Groups </h3>
<p>Through trials and errors, we've learned that effective teamwork is more complex than initially thought.
Firstly, a group is a dynamic entity, with members' circumstances and attitudes subject to change. We need to adapt our strategies to accommodate new situation and enable work-around and makeshifts.
Secondly, diversity among team members offers both opportunities and challenges. We must learn how to manage these differences effectively, seeking common ground while respecting individual preferences.
Lastly, consistent communication is crucial for successful teamwork. The absence or “ghosting” of any member from active participation can be detrimental and disappointing. We should keep this in mind when forming new teams in the future. </p>
