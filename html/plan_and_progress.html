	<h1 align="center">Plans and Progress</h1>
	<h3>Stage 1: Crew Background & Preliminary Planning</h3>
    <p>When our team first encountered this project task, we soon began a comprehensive brainstorming session. Regarding the team's background, each of our members is deeply interested in technological trends and is passionate about the integration of technology with culture and humanities. It's worth noting that our team consists of three international students: two from Myanmar and one from China. For these crew members, Vietnam offers a distinct and markedly divergent social environment compared to their countries of origin. Upon arriving in Vietnam, they have faced with considerable challenges in language expression and cultural communication, deeply experiencing the inconveniences and frustrations wrought by language barriers in both their daily lives and even academic endeavors. After preliminary team discussions, we expeditiously reached a consensus on the main direction for our project: To bridge divides between people hailing from different regions and cultures, with an emphasis on facilitating cross-cultural communication. Subsequent brainstorming sessions yielded the concept of conceiving a product to facilitate translation across various languages.</p>
    <h3>Stage 2: Further Exploration and Investigation</h3>
    <p>We subsequently partitioned task and embarked on a research endeavor to explore current available hardware and software translating solutions on the market. Our investigation revealed that while Google Translate enjoys widespread usage and offers support for a multitude of languages, there exist noteworthy areas where enhancement can be made. When use an app like Google Translate, it often results in conversations with slow and inefficient pace that can frustrate users, lacking rapid real-time translation capabilities. Moreover, translation precision is not consistently dependable, particularly when confronted with idiomatic expressions, colloquialisms, or less widely-spoken languages(compared to popular language like English), such as those languages originating from Southeast Asia. Another limitation pertains to the necessity for users to physically hold their phones, curtailing their freedom and rendering social interactions stiffer and less organic. 
    During our second meetup, inspired by team member Dean, we considered developing a hardware product to address these limitations.We contemplated that a pair of eyeglasses could serve as an optimal solution for several reasons:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Primarily, eyeglasses offer portability, catering to the perpetual translation requirements of individuals in foreign traveller setup. </li>
        <li>Secondly, eyeglasses inherently exhibit a user-friendly design that holds broad appeal among the general population. A product with eyeglasses characteristics also has the potential to be advantageous for marketing strategy, as exemplified by past campaigns, notably the Apple Watch campaign by Apple. </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Stage 3: In-depth Research </h3>
    <p>After our second meetup, we scoured the internet to gather data and assess the feasibility of our product idea. We discovered that there are existing products with similar features and ideas. One notable example is Apple's recently released Vision Pro, a powerful Augmented Reality (AR) product with various imaginative and magical applications. However, upon reviewing relevant YouTube videos, we found that Vision Pro has its limitations: </p>
    <ul>
        <li>First, its high Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price (MSRP) makes it beyond the reach of the average consumer. </li>
        <li>Secondly, its hefty product weight can lead to discomfort when worn by users for extended durations, thus diminishing its suitability for continuous usage. </li>
    </ul>
	<p>During our third meetup, we pondered whether our product idea remained viable given the impending release of Vision Pro. After detailed analysis, we concluded that our product could not only address the shortcomings of Vision Pro but also bring unique features and functionalities. Our product would be lighter, more affordable, and have a longer battery life. Moreover, we uncovered a novel opportunity: directing our focus toward assisting marginalized communities, thereby introducing a distinctive highlight point and carving out a unique niche for our product. 
    </p>
    <h3>Stage 4: Current Progress Stage </h3>
    <p>As of writing this report, we are still in the research and planning phase for our product, named "NBGlasses." We recognize the complexity and scope of managing such a project. To that end, we are learning to incorporate project management tools like Gantt charts. Additionally, we are currently in the midst of crafting presentation slides, a pivotal step in enticing potential angel investors and gaining a comprehensive grasp of our product's present scope and constraints for potential clients and our development team. We are meticulously devising testing protocols and scheduling to maximize our progress within the confines of the available time frame. </p>
    <h3>Future Contingency Plan: Key Focus for Successor Development Teams </h3>
    <p>If the project needs to be handed over to another team for unforeseen reasons, the new team may be advised to focus on the following challenges: </p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Collecting language data:</b> This undertaking is of considerable magnitude, demanding significant financial resources and meticulous planning of system architecture. Whether opting for an in-house development approach or leveraging third-party APIs, judicious strategic planning remains imperative.  </li>
        <li><b>Material picking and ergonomic design:</b> This area is often overlooked but could be a decisive factor that sets our product apart from competitors.</li>
        <li><b>Engaging with the educational and medical sectors:</b> The integration of social responsibility and a heightened emphasis on the humanities can exert a substantial impact on enhancing the product's competitive advantage. </li>
        <li><b>Resources - Acquisition and training of essential technical talent:</b> The assembly of a proficient and harmonious startup team will decisively shape the project's outcome, ultimately determining its success or failure. </li>
    </ul>
