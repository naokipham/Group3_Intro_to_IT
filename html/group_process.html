        <h1 align="center">Group processes and communications</h1>
        <p>Taking experience from practice during group activity for assignment 2 of the Intro to IT course, we realized that although the group did not have any major conflicts during the working process, efficiency and results were greatly delayed. It happened due to not being proactive. This means we must set basic regulations to change the above phenomenon: </p>
        <h3>Contact channel: </h3>
        <p>Project members will communicate with each other through a group chat on the Facebook Messenger platform. This group chat is a communication channel, in addition to reminding divided tasks and deadlines for each member, this is also a place where members can freely share difficulties encountered during work so that other members can support them. support. In case of emergency when we need to contact other members, we will contact them via personal phone number.</p>
        <h3>Working channel: </h3>
        <p>We work on Microsoft 365 and Microsoft OneDrive. As for Onedrive, this is an online document repository so we share a common workplace for members. All folders or files related to the project are placed together in the shared folder for team members. This, in addition to allowing members to quickly access files, is also a way for group members to check each other's progress. Microsoft 365 is software that members will work directly with files such as reports or presentation designs. There are also other applications and tools that members can use depending on the nature of the project such as Github, Canva, etc.</p>
        <h3>Meeting</h3>
        <p>Regarding the content of the meetings, we often have meetings to report and evaluate progress, then assign the next tasks to team members according to plan. We often voluntarily accept tasks and tasks that no one else has taken on will be divided equally with the contributions of all members. We will mostly meet face-to-face, however, if there are meetings where all members cannot be present, we will meet online through Microsoft Team. </p>
        <h3>Frequency</h3>
        <p>All team members are encouraged to message the group about daily work progress, mainly difficulties encountered while working so that the whole team can promptly handle it. In addition, every week the group will always have a meeting to report progress (mandatory) and continue assigning tasks, usually on Thursday.</p>
        <h3>Rules</h3>
        <p>We also set some basic rules with each other when working together to avoid possible conflicts and arguments: </p>
        <ol>
            <li> When assigned a task, the member must reply or at least react (like or heart) to the message as a confirmation that you have read the task and agree with the assigned task as well as the deadline. </li>
            <li>Be on time. Complete deadlines on time no matter what your reasons are. For group meetings, you must also arrive on time, and for special cases, you can arrive up to 10 minutes late and must give a reasonable reason for that.</li>
            <li>If you want to change the deadline, please notify everyone at least 1 day in advance. Also tell the group the reason, the difficulty, and the date you will submit it.</li>
        </ol>
        <p><b>Note:</b>If one of the members violates the above rules for the first or second time, they will be warned in front of the whole group. If that member continues to behave like that, especially procrastinating or neglecting the group work, we will write it on our peer evaluation and send your case to the lecturer for a final decision. </p>
