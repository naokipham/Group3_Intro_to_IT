                    <p class="team-member-info"> SID: S4022136 </p>
                    <p class="team-member-info">Zyra is from Myanmar, and it is her first semester studying at RMIT. She plans to pursue a Bachelor of Information Technology degree. Her hobbies include but are not restricted to calisthenics, practicing the guitar, and Lethwei. In her downtime, she relaxes by engaging in sports or enjoying music. IT has not always been her passion in life. However, during the Covid-19 pandemic, everything became digitized. Her final exam for high school also got pushed back for about two years. These changes lured her into the world of technology, where she printed her first "Hello, World" with the programming language, Python, and subsequently decided she wanted to pursue an education and a career in IT. Currently, she has no previous work in the IT industry.</p>

                    <p class="team-member-info"> SID: S4037889 </p>
                    <p class="team-member-info"> He is also Burmese (people who live in Myanmar), and this is his very first time studying abroad. The reason he chose to study at RMIT Vietnam is they offer a variety of world-class programs from Australia with a reasonable tuition fee. He likes swimming, reading comics, internet surfing, and sometimes, he plays games with his friends. The fact that his interest in cyber security and attacks grew larger day by day by seeing and searching articles about cyber-attacks and securing led him to choose to study IT. Currently, among the subjects that he is learning for this semester, he is keen on Introduction to Information Technology because it helps him to understand how big and diverse the IT world is, hence wanting him to deep dive into the IT world more and more. </p>

                    <p class="team-member-info"> SID: S4026699 </p>
                    <p class="team-member-info"> Ngan is a first year RMIT Information Technology student. She is now enrolled in three courses: Introductory Programming, and Practical Database Concepts. So far, she has learned a little bit about database and SQL commands, as well as Python programming. Intro to IT was undoubtedly the most interesting subject she took since it gave her an overview of the IT field. She has recently begun learning the HTML programming language and thoroughly loves it. She enjoys challenges; thus, this assignment piqued her curiosity and interest because she gets to experience extensive project preparation, planning and building source code for a website.</p>

                    <p class="team-member-info">Tommy is a first-year RMIT Information Technology student. Initially, he selected to study Business Management at RMIT Melbourne Australia for one year, but he considered the program to be uninteresting and unmotivating, so he returned to Vietnam and changed his branch to IT at RMIT Vietnam. He believes that IT will be a profitable venture that will help the world improve while also making a lot of money. Furthermore, he has an intense fascination in AI, which is one of the main reasons he opted to study Information Technology at RMIT Vietnam. </p>
