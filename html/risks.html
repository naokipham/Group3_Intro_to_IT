        <h1 align="center">Risks</h1>
        <p>There are risks associated with the development of this project, NBglasses, as with numerous other projects. To produce and launch a functional and feasible product, we would require the appropriate technology, the ability to understand the technicality of this project, teamwork, marketing capabilities, an ample amount of capital investment, and luck. In other aspects of life, there is no such thing as a reward without risks similarly our project comes with its own risks. The following are some of the risks we must take to set this project up. </p>
        <h3><u>1.Lack of skills & experience + Technology risks</u></h3>
        <p>These are the risks associated with our technical abilities and lack of experience working towards developing a product with a team.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Lack of technical skills & knowledge:</b>
            <br>As our team is full of freshmen, we do not have the best of abilities and a steady stream of knowledge yet. This would be a problem to deal with as this project requires copious amounts of skill including but not limited to using PyTorch for Natural Language Processing, Computer Vision for different sensory recognitions, and translations, along with the ability to create an Augmented Reality environment, and an ability to utilize Artificial Intelligence is needed. Similarly, some soft skills, namely time management, teamwork, communication, and problem-solving are necessary as well.  </li>
            <li><b>Lack of experience in development</b></li>
            <li><b>Lack of appropriate technology:</b>
            <br>Software such as Computer Vision(CV), Augmented Reality(AR), Natural Language Processing(NLP), and AI, along with hardware such as a circuit that is capable of supporting various wireless connections, a headset with a lightweight body, cameras, microphones, and multiple sensors are requirements for this project. We might not have the funding needed to financially support all these resources in the beginning, which may take a toll on our results. </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>2.Market risks </u></h3>
        <p>When developing a product and launching it, there will be market risks such as profitability and product pricing as capital is a crucial part of a startup. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Profitability & product pricing:  </b>
            <br>Our product will need to be profitable but also have reasonable product pricing that is affordable to the general public and not just the rich. We need to determine the perfect balancing point or our product might not be a viable option to our consumers. </li>
            <li><b>Investment:  </b>
            <br>There is a risk and possibility that we might not lure in enough investors to fund our project which might lead to some shortcomings.</li>
            <li><b>Competition/ Marketability: </b>
            <br>Many strong and well-known competitors such as Google have already expanded into this field. We will have to compete with them, thus the risk of whether our product would be marketable and be able to stand on its own against such competition is also a crucial determinant of our product success.  
        </li>

        </ul>
        <h3><u>3.Internal Conflict</u></h3>
        <p>When working in team environments, it is normal to have some level of conflict, due to this reason, we should expect some creative differences and various perceptions of the project and ideas. We must try to mitigate between each other and find the middle ground or back our arguments with reason. </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Issues with internal conflict:</b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><i>Time management:</i> With people having an argument in a team due to creative differences or anything else, we would need to have sufficient time to meet the customers expectations. </li>
                <li><i>Lack of communication reflected in poor output:</i>Without proper communication, we would have difficulty creating a viable product. The overall cost might also increase due to the increased number of follow-ups and trial runs we may need to make. This links back to the market risk of profitability. </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>4.Product Risks</u></h3>
        <p>The functionality and feasibility of our product negate numerous risks as well. For developing and launching our product, questions such as how successful our product would be and how reliable our product will be are two good questions to keep in mind. </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Poor performance in the market  </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><u>5.unforeseeable risks</u></h3>
        <p>Luck is a big factor in the success of a new product. Life is unpredictable. Take the Great Depression as an example, numerous businesses went under and a lot of them were unable to foresee what would happen to them abruptly. Thus, we would need to prepare for such factors as well.</p>
