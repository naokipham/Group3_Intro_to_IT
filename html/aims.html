        <h1 align="center">Aims</h1>
        <p> The primary specific aim of NBglasses is to help people worldwide overcome language barriers and enhance cross-cultural communication. Furthermore, it places a distinct emphasis on providing support for individuals with disabilities, significantly improving their social experiences. With the assistance of NBglasses, people from around the world will find it easier to engage in international travel and receive rapid, real-time translation assistance when communicating with local residents in foreign countries. The translation efficiency of this product would surpass that of traditional and even most of current translation tools, revolutionizing communication efficiency among individuals who speak different languages. Additionally, an area that has been rarely explored in the past, "Translation between individuals with disabilities and physically healthy individuals without disabilities," will now be realized and supported, filling a gap in social welfare and meeting economy-wise market demands. This is a tangible product that will prioritize ease of use, maintainable manufacturing costs, and suitability for mass production. The goal is for NBglasses to be widely accepted by the general public, not limited to few rich people as fancy toys. 
        </p>
        <p>To achieve this primary aim, we need to accomplish several sub-goals:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Intuitive User Interface:</b>Design an intuitive user interface that allows elderly individuals and individuals with disabilities to easily learn how to use the product. This will help the product's widespread acceptance among people. </li>
            <li><b>Frame Material and Component Selection:</b>Create a comprehensive database for natural language, including audio and text data. The database's structure should be designed to be universally compatible, allowing for compatibility of languages from around the world and serving users from a broader range of countries and regions.
            </li>
            <li><b>Build a Sign Language Database:</b>Focus on building a database for sign language, with a particular emphasis on modeling image information. Mappings from image to semantic need to be stored and available for retrieval, utilizing application of AI neural network technology. </li>

        </ol>
        <p>Additionally, there are some optional goals that can significantly enhance the product's attractiveness and competitiveness: </p>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Offline Translation Functionality:</b>Develop an offline translation feature for travelers, especially in situations where local network connections may be unreliable, such as right after landing. The offline translation function will further enhance the product's user experience. However, this requires algorithm engineers to develop compression algorithms and more compact local models. </li>
            <li><b>Multimodal Translation:</b>Enable the product to consider multiple channels of input during language translation. This includes not only the meaning of natural language itself but also the talker's body actions and expressions. This addition of emotional elements to translations makes them more natural and cordial.</li>
            <li><b>Collaboration with Educational and Medical Institutions:</b>Collaborate with educational and medical institutions and share relevant data with these organizations. This collaboration will help educational and medical institutions explore how to better serve individuals with disabilities and facilitate their integration into mainstream society.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>However, if the project's resources and time are limited, the most critical primary aim and most important aspect of this product should remain ensuring the provision of real-time, seamless translation services and offering special support for individuals with disabilities. This will be the core competitiveness and significance of the product. </p>
