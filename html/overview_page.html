                        <p>To sum up, our product will perform translation back and forth to the user whichever language they are encountering with. The device can detect not only sound from people or electronic devices but also scans images that have foreign languages. Then, these images can be translated into your desired language, and you can have an option of appearing as a line of sentence on your glasses or audio version of translated information. Moreover, this device can bring balanced experiences to people, so it could scan the sign language to enhance the communication among people with disabilities such as blindness, deafness, and muted people. Sign language will be translated into a spoken language as reported by user choice and it is also turned into an audio file for blind people to listen to. To aid in interacting with people who use sign language, NBglasses has the capability to receive voice audio as the input source. It will correspondingly direct the user on how to reply using sign language in real-time. The regular version would be a more simplified model. The user can choose the type of translation they wish to receive such as a visual translation on the glass of your glasses (this will be combined with AR technology) or an audio translation in the form of an audio file. It can be used to translate content on a variety of products in different languages to make people lives easier.The outcome would be beyond our imagination and would solve a lot of problems of language barrier. The reason that we have to mention how difficult it is to communicate with people who do not have a common language is real life problem that a lot of people are facing right now. And there is an abundant amount of people who have to deal with this problem every day, including people with disabilities such as blindness and loss of hearing, because not everyone they come across in daily life can speak sign language, etc. with the help of this product, we will no longer have a problem of not understanding what the other person is trying talk or sign and it could be a smart glasses for people who have difficulty in reading.

            <h2>Motivation</h2>
        
            <p>One of our main reasons for this project is for people who do not know how to speak in another language while they are living in another area aside from their motherland. Most of the time, learning new language is truly time-consuming job and even though you have sorted out how to process and learn foreign languages, it is still one of the handiest tasks and still have a lot of misunderstanding objects during when you are performing foreign language. For instance, it would be so frustrating that you cannot express what you are feeling the way you want even though you do know the language of the place you are in right now. Plus, we could add more features to our project to make communication better between every form of human being. The fact of overcoming the language barrier motivated us to find the best solution out of numerous sketch thoughts. As we go on, we also find out we can do more things to help people to encounter this problem with ease such as not only detecting the words that will be coming out of people mouth but also the audio from the electronic devices and the written languages on all the products. Plus, we could add more features to our project to make communication better between every form of human being. This is the catchiest part of our project because we put a feature called understanding sign languages. Our aim is to not have boundaries to be able to talk and laugh with your friends. The idea of this product and the things that could do with this product is going to be a big helpful impact nowadays people to people communication with the help of AI, AR, and other high-end technologies. Current day, specialists are trying to find a way to spread the awareness and benefit of using AR/VR in our everyday life with the help of rising tech called AI/ML. So, all the systems that used in this product surely going to get updated every time new feature emerge. If someone were to interest the idea of the project, we can make a strong statement about how this could be helpful to humankind and as realistic as we know what we need to study for this project. </p>

            <h2>Landscape</h2>
            <p>Similar systems and products are already on their way to people in the current market. Big companies such as Microsoft, Apple Inc and PlayStation, they are expanding their market share increasingly to the people in every form. For instance, PlayStation, their focus is on the people who love to play video games and they want their audiences to have a better gaming experience by bringing games into Virtual Reality and letting them play in it. However, other companies focus more on smoother and user-friendly daily usage of applications, by using technologies like AR/VR. I believe the products that are currently in the market, for entertainment and introducing AR/VR technologies to the targeted public. But NBglasses, our aim is to have people no struggle in having normal conversation situation. It does not matter you are blind, deaf, and not able to speak or read foreign language, we combined all those technologies to create a device that is more than entertainment, rather than a useful product that everyone going to want to have it, a necessary personal device. </p>
