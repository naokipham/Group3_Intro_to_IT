        <p>Before it can be made available to the public as a new viable choice on the market, our product, like any other decent project out there, must go through several rigorous testing sessions. According to experts from Qualtrics (ref), product testing brings about several benefits. Including but not limited to quality and reliability assurance, overall cost reduction, helping you determine the service life of your product, and potentially reducing the cost and resources required for the aftercare of a customer. Thus, we had to put in careful consideration when deciding on how best to test our product.</p>
        <p>Two different testing phases will be carried out. First, we will start off with concept testing. Concept testing is a type of research method in which you ask your target audience questions about your project ideas (ref). It is cost-effective and simple to carry out. For our project, we will start off by targeting the two main audience groups we would like to reach, frequent travelers and people with sensory disabilities including speech, hearing, and sight.  We will conduct 4 varying Single Concept Evaluation surveys with a size of about 200 people each (800 in total). Despite being slightly more costly than other types of survey, it will give us the most detailed feedback and it typically has a higher and faster response rate. The main purpose of this test will be to figure out the viability of our product, desirability, and the likelihood of purchase considering the price. With a clear and concise flow and language, our survey should be easy to answer. Once we receive feedback from our target audience, we will identify the concept that has the highest favorability. To conclude our concept testing, we will then move on to the next development stage using the most suitable concept. </p>
        <p>this phase with a smaller number of users will most certainly give assurance and guidance towards developing the most user-friendly and palpable solutions and products catering towards removing language barriers. All in all, these are two methods of testing we will implement in our development stag For the second phase of the product testing, we will carry out user observation testing. This simply means that we will be observing how the users use our glasses and gathering data in areas that are received well and potential bugs that cause frustration in a natural setting. This method of testing allows us to get an insight into the user experience and build relations with the users. After creating a product based on the response from the first testing stage and going through several trial-and-error runs until we have a pair of glasses that we feel satisfied with, we will carry out this phase of product testing. To find test users, we will pick out random colleagues and customers of the product. The scale of this testing stage should be around twelve users. A specific background is not required as we want our evaluation to be as spread out and relatable as possible to the normal everyday user. Carrying out several tests in e.</p>
