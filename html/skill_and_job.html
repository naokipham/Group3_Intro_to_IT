Hardware Engineer will mainly focus on developing the hardware and appearance of the glasses. Software Engineer will certainly develop the functions of the glasses. The product development engineer will research the market, and have the ability to work with Hardware Engineer and Software Engineer to improve and develop NB glasses in the most comprehensive way. To bring our products to market, we definitely need communication, which is also the reason we will hire a marketing person.</p>
