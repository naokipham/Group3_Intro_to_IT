	<h1>Skill and job</h1>
	<p>Our project still has some limitations and above all we always want to develop NB glasses into a useful and widely used product. Therefore, to bring NB glasses to the next stage, we need to recruit positions such as Hardware Engineer, Software Engineer, Product Development Engineer, and marketing (PR & Communication Executive). Hardware Engineer will mainly focus on developing the hardware and appearance of the glasses. Software Engineer will certainly develop the functions of the glasses. The product development engineer will research the market, and have the ability to work with Hardware Engineer and Software Engineer to improve and develop NB glasses in the most comprehensive way. To bring our products to market, we definitely need communication, which is also the reason we will hire a marketing person. Here are some requirements for the above position:</p>
